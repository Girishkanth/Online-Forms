# Online Forms

## Project Concept
**Online Forms** is a frontend web application that allows users to create, customize, and share forms. Users can collect responses from others via a shareable link, and view responses in a structured format. The project focuses on building a dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly form builder interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
